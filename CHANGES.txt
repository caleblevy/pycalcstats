Version 0.1.1a  2010-10-??????
    * stats is now aimed at Python 3.1 or better. Support functions for
      Python 2.5 have been removed.
    * stats now aims to guarantee a single pass through the data for most
      routines.
    * Serious numerical instability in variance and standard deviation
      functions due to use of a naive algorithm. (Thanks to Kurt Smith for
      spotting this). Changed to Welford's method for calculating variance.
    * Similar changes to correlation, covariance and linear regression.
    * More tests. Thanks to geremy condra.
